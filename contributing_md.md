# Contributing to ML Model Deployment Hub

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone your fork locally**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-model-deployment-hub.git
cd ml-model-deployment-hub
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
```

4. **Create a feature branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

5. **Make your changes and test**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Code Style

We use Python's PEP 8 style guide. Key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Line length should be under 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Code Formatting
We recommend using `black` for code formatting:

```bash
pip install black
black app.py
```

## Testing

Before submitting a PR, make sure:

1. **The app runs without errors**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **All features work as expected**:
   - Test prediction functionality
   - Verify all visualizations render
   - Check model performance metrics
   - Test data export features

3. **Code follows style guidelines**

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
